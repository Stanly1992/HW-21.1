                <em>Hello, I'm Stanislav, a 31-year-old currently pursuing a career as a QA
                    Manual Engineer. With over a decade of experience serving as an officer in the
                    merchant fleet, I gained valuable skills and knowledge that have influenced my
                    professional journey.
                    <br>Additionally, I have dedicated myself to continuing my education, achieving
                        high qualifications along the way.</em>
            </p>

            <p>Outside of work and studies, my heart belongs to my loving wife. We share a
                deep bond and cherish each moment together. In our home, we are proud pet
                parents to both a cat and dog â€“ they bring joy and laughter to our daily lives.</p>
